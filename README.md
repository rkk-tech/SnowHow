# Project Title

SnowHow

## Summary
Optimizing the streets to be first cleared out of snow and in which order.
Based on trafic data, distance between streets with high traffic, households on streets, previous trafic accidents or injuries and other open data.
## Background
Yearly problem

On winters when big amount of snow rains in short period of time.

Prioritise the order and necessity of cleaning streets and appointing maintenance machinery to certain area.
Creating maps and street prioritazion for machinery for which areas to be cleared first and in which order.
Optimizing maintenance work
Reducing accidents and injuries
Reducing trafic jams

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Users 
Maintenance Work planning 
Snowplowing machinery and operators
Trafic planners


Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

This is how you create code examples:


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

Road traffic, Open data from Finnish roads

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

Coding accintance, lead and ideas to get the project flying.
How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you need to move on?
